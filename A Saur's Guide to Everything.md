# The Cast

## Mudsaur

Mudsaur is the first Saur. Mudsaur can usually be found in [Yellowstone National Park](https://google.com/search?q=Yellowstone+National+Park), because there's a lot of mud there made from the bubbling [mud pots](https://google.com/search?q=Yellowstone+Mud+Pots). However, a part of the spirit of Mudsaur lives in every block of mud ever created. If Mudsaur doesn't get enough mud, he takes some of the hot geyser water and mixes it with dirt to make more mud. Mudsaur originally created the [Opposition Law](#opposition-law) after the other five main Saurs ([Bulba](#bulba), [Ivy](#ivy), [Vena](#vena), [Sam](#sam), and [Hyacinth](#hyacinth)) were created.

## Bulba

Bulba is the second Saur. Unlike most Saurs, he prefers to be called Bulba, without the `-saur` suffix. Bulba used to be the Head at [Tesla Tech](#tesla-tech), then became demoted when they changed to [BushBushTech](#bushbushtech). He again became the Head of [SaurTech](#saurtech) when they changed from [BushBushTech](#bushbushtech) to [SaurTech](#saurtech). Now he mainly works in the [FunDay](#funday) subdivision. He came up with [Killing Day](#day-killing-day), the day that occurs every other Wednesday.

## Ivy

Ivy is the third Saur. Like Bulba, he prefers to be called Ivy, without the suffix. Ivy works as Assistant Manager at the FunDay subdivision of SaurTech. He came up with Amnesia Day (every Wednesday) and Random Comments Day (every Thursday).

## Vena

Vena is the fourth Saur. He prefers to be called Vena instead of Venasaur. Vena is the fattest saur (except for Fatsaur), weighing a googol pounds (10<sup>100</sup>); and works as Manager at the [FunDay](#funday) subdivision of [SaurTech](#saurtech).

## Sam

Sam is the fifth Saur. He prefers to be called Sam instead of Samsaur. Sam now works at **Hyacinth's Cheapo Store** as a sales clerk. Before that, he founded the FunDay subdivision of **BushBushTech** and came up with Stay Home Day (Mondays), Thank God It's Friday Day (Fridays), and Shopping Day (Tuesdays).

## Hyacinth

Hyacinth is the only Saur who never worked at **SaurTech** or **BushBushTech**. She works at her own company, **Hyacinth's Rich Guy Store**, where she sells anything you can think of (except anti-barf pills) for extremely large prices.
